### Hey there! 🚀
  
Hi, I'm Jeff, a self-taught developer from <img src="/meta/images/germany.svg" /> <b>Germany</b> and currently doing my <b>B.Sc. Applied Computer Science</b> @ [Nordakademie](https://www.nordakademie.de/). As a [dual student](https://www.ue-germany.com/blog/en/what-does-dual-study-mean-in-practice/#:~:text=This%20combination%20of%20study%20program,and%20do%20an%20apprenticeship%20simultaneously.) I'm fully employed at an aerospace corporation, which gives me the opportunity to gain a lot of (work) experience besides my studies.
